# DhakaStocksRetrieve_API
A demo web REST API I am currently working on for my thesis project. 

FOR SECURITY PURPOSE,
I did not provide the Google Firebase Realtime database credentials file in JSON format

You can use this code as a base for creating any REST API of your own

For displaying data, I have only used GET request and is not necessarily a RESTful API
and display data in JSON format from a given database

For my case, I displayed all the data from Google Firebase realtime database as JSON format
under REST endpoint
